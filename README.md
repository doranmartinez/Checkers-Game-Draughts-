# Checkers-Game-Draughts-

Done in x86 using MIPS.
Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming class was tailored around this one project. Every week we were given guidelines and constructs in order to accomplish the program. Although my program is unfinished the game is playable between 2 players. The end result was to create a game which a user plays a "robot". Nonetheless I have created a working Draughts game.
